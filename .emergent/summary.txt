The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive accounting application (Opensoftt Muhasebe) from scratch, iterating based on user requests. Initial work involved setting up the FastAPI backend and React frontend, implementing core modules like user authentication, customer (cari) management, payments, transactions, and reports. Key features added chronologically include cash management, Recently Added dashboard, total sums on screens, partial payment processing, and enhanced date-filtered reporting with Excel export. A significant recurring challenge was deploying these changes to the production environment, which caused persistent CORS errors and login issues due to stale frontend builds and un-seeded production databases. The engineer meticulously debugged and fixed backend CORS configurations, streamlined frontend API calls using a  for dynamic URLs, and implemented robust admin user seeding. The latest interaction confirms the backend is healthy, and the AI engineer is guiding the user through the final login test in the production environment.

<product_requirements>
The user requested an accounting program (Opensoftt Muhasebe) for various businesses (market, grocery, clothing) to manage current accounts (cariler) and payments. Core requirements included:
- **Cari Takibi**: Track current accounts, debts, and credits.
- **Ödeme Yönetimi**: Record payments, track remaining balances, and support partial payments.
- **Kasa Yönetimi**: Manage cash flow, including income (gelir), expenses (gider), and net balance.
- **Raporlama**: Date-based reports, general reports displaying overall financial status (debt, credit, net cash), with Excel export and in-app preview.
- **Kullanıcı Yönetimi**: Secure login with username/password, initial admin user () with ability to change credentials.
- **Tasarım**: Professional blue-white theme, modern UI/UX with icons, and user guidance/notifications.
- **Veri Kalıcılığı**: Server-side data storage (MongoDB) for multi-device access.
- **Gelişmiş Özellikler**: Display current debt/credit on customer cards, add debt entry dates, payment reminders/notifications, and a Son Eklenenler (Recently Added) section on the dashboard.
The implementation so far has addressed all these features, building a full-stack application with a FastAPI backend, React frontend, and MongoDB database.

<pending_tasks>
- The user is currently facing a login issue on the custom domain, which is a deployment/environment configuration problem, not a feature implementation gap.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was debugging a persistent login failure on the user's custom domain (). Despite extensive code changes (CORS fixes, dynamic API URL in frontend, robust admin seeding), the production environment seemed to be running stale code, still making API calls to the old preview URL () or failing due to missing admin user.

The AI engineer has performed the following actions in the last few messages:
1.  Confirmed  is correctly configured on the backend for .
2.  Modified the frontend (, , etc.) to dynamically determine the backend API URL, preferring  if  is not correctly set.
3.  Provided console commands to the user to test the backend's health endpoint () and to directly attempt a login via  from the browser console on the custom domain.
4.  Identified that the  endpoint is responding .
5.  Is now awaiting the results of the  command from the user's browser console to definitively pinpoint if the problem is with the login credentials, missing admin user in production, or still a URL/deployment issue. The user provided error logs indicating  and still hitting . The AI has again emphasized the critical need for redeployment and browser cache clearing. The last user input provided only the health check response, and the AI asked for the login test result.
